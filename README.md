# Mathematics
- This repository contains selected notes and comments on various mathematical topics written by Simon Foldvik, most of which are of an expository nature.
- Permalinking here should be safe for a while, but the notes are intended to be hosted elsewhere in the future.
- Contact me if you end up permalinking here and would like to get notified of a future migration.
